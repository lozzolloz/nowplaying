A basic app set up with authentication/authorisation with Spotify and basic access to spotify-web-api-js.

Use this as a basis for apps working with Spotify.

When creating a new app, you must go to `/auth-server-authentication-authorization_code/app.js` and update with the `client_id` and `client_secret` for your new app, generated by Spotify for Developers. You must also update `scopes` (line 53) as you go, for every function you add to your app.

In `/auth-server-authentication-authorization_code`, run `node app.js` in the terminal.
In `/client`, run `npm run start`.

And you're good to go!
